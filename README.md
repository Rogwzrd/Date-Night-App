Date Night

An app focused on creating an evening of fun and food based on your wants, cravings, and your "flavor profile". The app then gives you a curated movie and a list of dinner ideas (which also includes a link to a full recipe) based on your "flavor profile" to top off your night!

***Technologies Used:***

***Semantic UI:***Semantic UI is a visual framework much like bootstrap that is used to style web pages. The surface is merely scratched in this application of Semantic. The page is responsive and the card function is used to create recipe like cards on the results page after the user inputs their data and hit submit.

***Yummly API:***The yummly api is the largest recource called upon in this app. The user is given 7 separate points in which they can input data to seach Yummly's very deep recipe database to create extremely customized results based on said input. It was a challenge to give the user so much flexibiliy while still giving them a results without any errors.

***OMDB API:*** The OMDB api is utilized by syncing the users "flavor profile" decisions with a highly curated set of movies. The user's highest ranked flavor type  the level of spiciness chosen and then pulls a movie title. That movie title is then put into a search query that pulls data from the OMDB API and displays a poster, title, and a short plot of the chosen movie.
